# extractptcompaniesinfo

This file allows you to extract information about companies in Portugal, from two different websites.

You must have a .xml file with a column (labeled as "empresas") with a list of portuguese companies. 

The path to the file must be changed in the code and you will be asked if you are using Linux or Windows. This changes the code slightly in terms of
directing to the path of the .xml file with the company list and the path where you will save your final files (same path).

The code can proccess around 250 companies per hour. Run in a terminal. Not in Google Colab or Pycharm. If you are using Pycharm, choose an option to run in a 
Terminal, otherwise the code will be interrupted without warning and without any error. Anyway, a solution could be to split into lists with only 3.000 companies. 

The project is not complete, but someone who knows how to code with Python can use this with a few twecks.

Thanks you!
